Hi! My name is Deon Taljaard. This is my personal site, which I mainly use as my knowledge base. I enjoy learning and sharing my knowledge. I hope you find it insightful and interesting.

I'm an application developer based in Centurion, South Africa. To develop software is both my job and my hobby and I love it. 

I believe in having a balance in life. Thus, in my personal time, there are a host of things that I keep myself busy with. Amongst other things, I:

* serve as youth mentor / leader at our [congregation](http://ashleagardenschurchofchrist.co.za/)
* spend time with my fianc√©e
* hang out with friends
* work on a personal project with my best friend
* try (yes, try) and stay fit in the gym
* play stuff on my acoustic guitar
* lehre mich Deutsch

I never get time to do all of the above in one day, however, I never sit around twirling my fingers and try to make the most of the days on Earth I have been blessed with.

A big thank you to <a href="http://www.bronwynalyson.com" target="_blank">Bronwyn Alsyon Photography</a> for the profile pic and logo design.

Thanks for reading!
